const conclusion = `
Despite the JavaScript fatigue™ and the dramas (remember the ["leftpad gate"](http://developer.telerik.com/featured/left-pad-indicative-fragile-javascript-ecosystem/)), 2016 was a great year for the community, with the rise of projects like {vuejs} and {react-native}, and new projects like {yarn} or {create-react-app}.
