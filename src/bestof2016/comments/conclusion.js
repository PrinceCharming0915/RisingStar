const conclusion = `
Despite the JavaScript fatigue™ and the dramas (remember the ["leftpad gate"](http://developer.telerik.com/featured/left-pad-indicative-fragile-javascript-ecosystem/)), 2016 was a great year for the community, with the rise of projects like {vuejs} and {react-native}, and new projects like {yarn} or {create-react-app}.

We have been talking about projects that got traction on Github in 2016 but what really matters is developer's satisfaction.
So if you want a more qualitative approach, check the results from Sacha Greif’s [State of JavaScript](http://stateofjs.com/) survey. More than 9,000 responses were collected!

It's time to think about 2017, where are the next rising stars?
Here my 10 picks of the year, the projects and the ideas I liked in 2016 and that will keep up growing in 2017:

* {vuejs}: the momentum will not stop
* {electron}
* {create-react-app} (used to build this page!)
* {react-native}
* {gatsby}
* {yarn}: it's nice to see the community working hard to make npm (our every day tool) better
* The concept of "Progressive Web Applications"
* Micro-services with node.js, made easy to deploy with solutions like [Now](https://zeit.co/now), [Webtask.io](https://webtask.io/) or [Stdlib](https://stdlib.com/)
* The amazing work by the [Zeit](https://zeit.co/) team, especially their hosting solution called [now](https://zeit.co/now) and projects like {nextjs}.
* {graphql}: all my friends told me that something big is coming!
