const conclusion = `
Despite the JavaScript fatigue™ and the dramas (remember the ["leftpad gate"](http://developer.telerik.com/featured/left-pad-indicative-fragile-javascript-ecosystem/)), 2016 was a great year for the community, with the rise of projects like {vuejs} and {react-native}, and new projects like {yarn} or {create-react-app}.

We have been talking about projects that got traction on Github in 2016 but what really matters is developer's satisfaction.
So if you want a more qualitative approach, check the results from Sacha Greif’s [State of JavaScript](http://stateofjs.com/) survey. More than 9,000 responses were collected!

It's time to think about 2017, where are the next rising stars?
If had to pick 10 projects or concepts that will keep up growing, I'd choose:

* {vuejs}: the momentum will not stop
* {electron}
* {create-react-app} (used to build this page!)
* {react-native}
* {gatsby}
* {yarn}: it's nice to see the community working hard to make npm (our every day tool) better
* The concept of "Progressive Web Applications" (web application that run offline, using a technology called Service Worker, read [this article](https://ponyfoo.com/articles/progressive-app-serviceworker) from Nicolás Bevacqua)
* Micro-services with node.js
* I was amazed by what did folks from [Zeit](https://zeit.co/), especially their hosting solution called [now](https://zeit.co/now) and projects like {nextjs}.
* {graphql}: all my friends told me that something big is coming!
