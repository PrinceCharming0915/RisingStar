## Introduction

We created [bestof.js.org](http://bestof.js.org/) to gather the most popular open-source projects about the web platform and node.js: frameworks, libraries, css toolkits... but also documentation and learning tools.

Let's see **by the numbers** which projects got traction in 2016.

Who are the 2016 winners ?
